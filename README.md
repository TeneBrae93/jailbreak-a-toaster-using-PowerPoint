## 📉 **When DEF CON 33 Went Up in Smoke**

According to [defcon33cancelled.com](https://defcon33cancelled.com), DEF CON 33 was officially **cancelled** after an unprecedented tech meltdown.  

Organizers attempted to coordinate the entire conference over **Microsoft Teams**. The result:  
- Endless breakout loops.  
- 2FA pop-ups on hotel room doors.  
- An unpatched “Mute Button of Doom” exploit.  

One frustrated organizer described it as a **“digital oubliette”** — a place you enter but never escape.

## 🥖 **Operation: PowerPoint Toaster Jailbreak**

In a desperate bid to salvage communications, our red team proposed the **Toaster-as-a-Service (TaaS)** plan:

1. **Connect a toaster to the DEF CON Wi-Fi**.  
2. **Use PowerPoint macros to grant it root access**.  
3. **Project emergency DEF CON slides directly onto toast**.  

```vba
Sub ToastJailbreak()
    MsgBox "Connecting Toaster to Teams..."
    Shell "toastctl --enable-breadmode /slot1"
    MsgBox "Now streaming Keynote: Burned.Edges.ppsx"
End Sub
```

### 🧨 **Unexpected Outcomes**
- The toaster **blue-screened**, then emitted the Windows error sound.  
- Our slide deck **burned onto the bread**.  
- 37 attendees left thinking this was a **CTF challenge**.

## 🔥 **The Fallout**

- DEF CON 33: Cancelled.  
- Microsoft Teams: Permanently banned from the premises.  
- Toaster: Now considered a “high-risk IoT device” and quarantined by the hotel.  
- Lesson learned: **You can phish a user, but you can’t socially engineer sourdough.**
